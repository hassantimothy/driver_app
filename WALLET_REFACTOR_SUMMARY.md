# Wallet Screen Modularization Summary

## Problem
The original `wallet_screen.dart` file was 529 lines long, violating Flutter best practices and the single responsibility principle.

## Solution
Refactored the large file into 4 focused widget components following Flutter best practices:

### Widget Components Created

1. **`wallet_balance_card.dart`** (89 lines)
   - Displays wallet balance with gradient background
   - Shows monthly change indicators
   - Clean, focused component for balance display

2. **`wallet_type_sheet.dart`** (133 lines)
   - Modal bottom sheet for wallet type selection
   - Includes WalletType data model
   - Handles wallet switching functionality

3. **`transaction_list.dart`** (174 lines)
   - Transaction history display
   - Includes Transaction data model
   - Formatted transaction items with proper date handling

4. **`wallet_action_buttons.dart`** (142 lines)
   - Bottom-positioned action buttons
   - Gradient button designs
   - Handles deposit, withdraw, transfer, and history actions

5. **`widgets.dart`** (Barrel file)
   - Exports all widget components
   - Provides clean import structure

### New Wallet Screen Features

- **Wallet Type Selection**: Tap the balance card to open a bottom sheet with different wallet types (Driver, Escrow, Savings, Fuel)
- **Dynamic Content**: Transaction list and balance update based on selected wallet type
- **Bottom Action Buttons**: Fixed bottom navigation for wallet operations
- **Improved UX**: Better visual hierarchy and interaction patterns

### Code Reduction
- **Original**: 529 lines in one file
- **New**: ~100 lines main screen + 4 focused components
- **Improvement**: Better maintainability, reusability, and testability
